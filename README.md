Conway's Game of Life on Canvas
===============================

This is a JavaScript
[Conways's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
toy I wrote in 2010 while learning use `<canvas>` elements.
There's nothing interesting about this implementation, 
but it's tweaked to be fun to play with.

To run it, clone the repo and open the HTML file locally, or you 
can [see it in action here](https://gould.io/static/2010/life-canvas/life.html).

To use it, drag an element from the templates at the top onto the canvas, or set individual
cells by clicking. Hit the Play button (&#x25B6;) to start the simulation.
You can clear the canvas with the Blank button, or advance a single frame (when paused) with the **1** button.
